# Mathematical Operations

Use a Mathematical Operations custom window to apply mathematical operations to two numbers.

The Mathematical Operations custom window supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When the two numbers arrive in the custom window from the Source window, the selected mathematical operation (default is multiplication) is applied to these numbers. The mathematical operation used can be changed in the initialization table on the custom window. This custom window used Python code to calculate the result of the mathematical operation.
